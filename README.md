# Tennessee Eastman Process Dataset Analysis and Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models including Random Forest, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Autoencoder for the analysis and anomaly detection on the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset.

## Introduction

The Tennessee Eastman Process dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of process monitoring and fault detection. It simulates a chemical process with various operating conditions and potential faults. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models to detect anomalies or faults in the process.

## Dataset

The Tennessee Eastman Process dataset is available [here](link-to-dataset). It contains measurements from various sensors in the chemical process under different operating conditions and fault scenarios.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tennessee-eastman-process.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Execute the Jupyter notebooks to train and evaluate the models:
random_forest.ipynb: Implementation of Random Forest for anomaly detection.
lstm.ipynb: Implementation of LSTM for anomaly detection.
autoencoder.ipynb: Implementation of Autoencoder for anomaly detection.

## Results

Random Forest achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
LSTM achieved an accuracy of Y% on the test set.
Autoencoder achieved an accuracy of Z% on the test set.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored the application of Random Forest, LSTM, and Autoencoder for anomaly detection on the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. Each model demonstrated varying degrees of success in detecting anomalies. Further experimentation and fine-tuning may be required to improve the performance of these models.
